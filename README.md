# What this repo is for

Modern voice recognition engines reasonably seamlessly allow you to dictate prose, with minimal configuration necessary.

If you want to do much on top of that, however, you have to do more configuration.

To start, I'm planning on setting up:

- A key to toggle between dictation/command mode, so that I will never accidentally trigger voice commands during regular dictation.
- Voice briefs for punctuation, symbols, templates, shortcodes, and other entry-related things.
- Voice commands for all Emacs commands I regularly use (the same as are directly bound on [my keyboard layout](https://github.com/StevenTammen/taser), for the most part).
- Better voice spelling (i.e., rather than just using the names of the letters of the alphabet, using a made-up alphabet with less similar-sounding briefs for the letters, to avoid ambiguity in output).

Some of this configuration I can probably do in Dragon Professional 15 directly (the voice recognition software I am using at present). Some things, however, I will probably need to wire up using [Talon](https://talonvoice.com/docs/) and/or [Dragonfly](https://github.com/dictation-toolbox/dragonfly).

I am not very far in all this yet, but have started. TODO - push up what is there thus far.
